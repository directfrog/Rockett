So basically when it runs the following error gets returned:

File "C:\Users\direc\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python38\lib\site-packages\recipe_scrapers\_schemaorg.py", line 69, in total_time
raise SchemaOrgException("Cooking time information not found in SchemaOrg")
recipe_scrapers._exceptions.SchemaOrgException: recipe-scrapers exception: Cooking time information not found in SchemaOrg


Basically the web scraper is malfunctioning and needs to be fixed. It is not detecting the link properly.
