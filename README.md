Rockett (Reduction Of Careless Kitchen Emissions Today and Tomorrow) is an app that is designed for poeple to find a recipe to cook based on what they currently have at hand.
All they have to do is take a look in teh fridge/pantry, tell rockett what ingredients they have, and rockett will find a bunch of recipes for them which they can pick 
(complete with the extra ingredients needed, instructions and of course a picture of the final result).

The project is currently in its early stages as we are still experimenting with web-scraping functoinalities and basic app development, however it will soon be on its feet!
